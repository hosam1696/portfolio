                                , I'm Hosam,

                                Zagazig University college, my major study is
                                <i>Electronics Engineering</i>,meanwhile i have a big interest in
                                <i>software Engineering</i> field that drive me to dig into. during my college years
                                i had
                                taken some courses about programming like
                                <i>Matlab, Visual Basic, C and Java</i>. my curiosity in Computer and Engineering
                                field
                                is the only thing i feel comfortable with learning new stuff every day, the idea of
                                a
                                thing not shorten on specific way of doing is what makes the path journey more
                                challenging
                                and interesting in the same time.
                            </article>
                            <article>I am Familiar with
                                <b>Javascript</b> and
                                <b>Python</b>, However the most language i use in daily basis is
                                <i>Javascript</i>
                                     i proud to be one of self-taught programmers branch. it was a tough journey to take
                                     but awarding in the end. first i start
                                     in web development by trying to understand the concepts of programming with
                                     javascript
                                     to be specific and for sure took me a while be grasped, Javascript let us as a
                                     programmers
                                     in somehow to look in different perspective on it's implementation , it has some
                                     pros
                                     like multi purpose easy to start with language,one can see javascript code on web
                                     development
                                     both client and server sides it also can be used to make a desktop and mobile
                                     applications.
                            </article>
                            <article>what i'm seeking to do nowadays is to find skilled and innovative team to join,
                                     sharing and
                                     participating in new ideas that matters. i believe that Great things does not
                                     reveal
                                     from
                                     nothing.
